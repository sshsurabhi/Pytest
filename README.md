# Setup

- We should use our default python installation
- We have to install `pytest` in your applicable version
- run `python3 -m pytest`/ 'python .m pytest' from the repository-root should be enough to run tests

# Tasks

1. There were some issues with the Tests / Implemenation (inside Task-main remopistory)
   - Resolve all issues until all tests are passing.
   - Each test explains the specification, assumption, task and optionally a hint.
2. Folder Solution is the version which has all the tests were passed without issues.
